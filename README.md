# NLP-Exercise-1
Python file and corpus for the exercise 1 in NLP

To run the Python file you must have the folder with the Gaelic corpus textfiles in the same directory. 

By default, the code will save the plots it makes into the folder it is in. 
The adress can be changed at the top of the code.
An option can also be toggled to show the plots instead of saving them.
